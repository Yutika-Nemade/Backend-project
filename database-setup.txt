goto mongodb atlas.com
create new project

create new database user
add IP address

connect to database

add url to .env file

add db_name in constants.js

there are two approaches to connect to db
1. write function to connect db in index.js (not good approach)
2. write function to connect db in db folder (professional approach)

install dotenv, mongoose, express

Two important points about database connectivity: 

1. When connecting to databases, handling potential data-not-found scenarios is essential. Employ try/catch blocks or promises to manage errors or we can also use promises.

key to remember : ( wrap in try-catch )

2. Database operations involve latency, and traditional synchronous code can lead to blocking, where the program waits for the database query to complete before moving on. So, we should async/await which allows for non-blocking execution, enabling the program to continue with other tasks while waiting for the database response. 

key to remember :  ( always remember the database is in another continent, so use async await)

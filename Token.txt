Access token - short duration
refrsh token - long duration

we can use the resource for authentication requirement until we have access token
eg. File upload

As access token are of short duration, it may happen that our session gets expired and then we have put the password again to login
in this case, refresh token comes to the picture, we store refesh token in database also provide it to the users.
We validate user through access token only, but no need to put password everytime.
User will hit the refesh token in endpoint and will match this with the refresh token stored in our database, if it matches then login is successful

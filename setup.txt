Professional setup for backend

create new folder
push on github

check whether node is installed or not -- use command --> node -v

npm init

create public folder
create public/temp
create .gitkeep file inside public/temp folder. --> this .gitkeep file helps us to push and track the empty folders
(like if we are storing images in application, usually we store them in temp folder, so in this case .gitkeep file helps us)

We can create gitignore files using gitignore generator website(in that site we have multiple codes for multiple programming languages and packages)

create .env

also in package.json, add type: module (so that we can use import syntax)

install nodemon --> npm i -D nodemon
-D is used for dev dependency, dev dependency is the dependency that we used during development, don't use in production

nodemon restarts the server everytime after doing changes in application

In package.json file under scripts object add "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
when we will run npm dev run command it will restart server

create new folder in root directory as src
create files in src -- app.js, index.js, constants.js
create folders in src -- 
    controllers -- all the functionalities are present in this folder
    db -- database connection logic is written in this folder
    middlewares -- contains the code that need to run in between eg. when we get the request but before     fulfilling that request we get cookies (kind of checking)
    models -- it contains the data structure of models
    routes -- it contains all routing
    utils -- it contains utilities eg. file upload, mailing


install prettier
to sync the formatting of all code (as a team works on a project so all should use same formatting)
npm i -D prettier
add 2 files .prettierrc -- contains all configuration 
            .prettierignore -- contains all the files that should not follow prettier formatting like (.env, node-modules)

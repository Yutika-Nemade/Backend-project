install cookie-parser and cors

when we are using any middleware or for configuration always write
app.use(cors())


there are four parameters 
err, req, res, next
next is used when we are using middlewares, next will pass the information to other


create a js file in utils folder so that we can use the same function(wrapper function) wherever required
